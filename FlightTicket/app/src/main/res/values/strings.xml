They should attempt to minimise the use of the lavatory and any non-essential movement must be avoided.In case of emergencies, cabin crew have only about 90 seconds to evacuate the whole plane. Therefore, every second is valuable. The window shades have to be pulled up so that the eyes of passengers and cabin crew would be adjusted to the light or the dark outside. Also, in this way, passengers can help the cabin crew spot if something is off.Passengers are asked to not recline their seats during take-off and landing for the same reason that most of the other things are asked of them. In case of emergencies, passengers need to be able to evacuate as quickly as possible. Moreover, when the seats are put up, they are locked. So, they are impacted less during accidents and therefore are more safer.</string>
